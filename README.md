# Flower-Evolution-Simulation
This project simulates flower evolution using a genetic algorithm in Python with a Tkinter GUI. Flowers evolve through selection, crossover, and mutation based on user interaction for fitness. Each flowerâ€™s traits, like color and petal count, adapt over generations, visualizing evolutionary principles in an interactive, evolving display.
